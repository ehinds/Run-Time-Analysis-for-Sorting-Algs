# Run-Time-Analysis-for-Sorting-Algs
Compares three different sorting algorithms, (Insertion sort, Merge sort, and Quicksort) and compares run times for all three algorithms. Runs each sorting algorithm several times on increasing array sizes and takes an average. All algorithms run on the same unsorted arrays.
